PRVDR_NUM_TB Provider Number Table

 First two positions are the State in which the provider is located.
           As two-digit state codes have been exhausted, CMS has implemented a
           two-position alpha-numeric coding system for State Codes. The following
           is a list of all CMS assigned State Codes to be used with the CCN:

       (1) These facilities (SPRDFS) will be assigned
           the same provider number whenever they
           are recertified.

       (2) The 6400-6499 series of provider numbers
           in Iowa (16), South Dakota (43) and Texas (45)
           have been used in reducing acute care costs (RACC)
           experiments.

       (3) In Virginia (49), the series 7100-7299 has
           been reserved for statewide subunit components
           of the Virginia state home health agencies.

       (4) Parent agency must have a number in the
           7000-7299, 7400-7799 or 8000-8499 series.

       NOTE:
         There is a special numbering system for units
         of hospitals that are excluded from prospective
         payment system (PPS) and hospitals with SNF
         swing-bed designation.  An alpha character in
         the third position of the provider number
         identifies the type of unit or swing-bed
         designation as follows:

           M = Psychiatric Unit in Critical Access Hospital
           R = Rehabilitation Unit in Critical Access Hospital
           S = Psychiatric unit (excluded from PPS)
           T = Rehabilitation unit (excluded from PPS)
           U = Swing-Bed Hospital Designation for Short-
               Term Hospitals
           V = Alcohol drug unit (prior to 10/87 only)
           W = Swing-Bed Hospital Designation for Long
               Term Care Hospitals
           Y = Swing-Bed Hospital Designation for
               Rehabilitation Hospitals
           Z = Swing Bed Designation for Critical Access
               Hospitals

         There is also a special numbering system for
         assigning emergency hospital identification
         numbers (non participating hospitals).  The
         sixth position of the provider number is as
         follows:

           E = Non-federal emergency hospital
           F = Federal emergency hospital
